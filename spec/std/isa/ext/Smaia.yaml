  MACHINE_VIRTUAL_INTERRUPTS:
    description: |
      List of interrupt numbers (13-63) for which the corresponding bits in mvien and mvip are writable.
      Implementations may freely choose which bits are writable.
      Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupt sources should be read-only zero.

        type: integer
        minimum: 13

  MACHINE_VIRTUAL_INTERRUPTS_ALWAYS_ENABLED:
    description: |
      List of interrupt numbers (13-63) for which the corresponding bits in mvien are read-only-1.
      Must be a subset of MACHINE_VIRTUAL_INTERRUPTS.
      These interrupts are always enabled and cannot be disabled by software.
