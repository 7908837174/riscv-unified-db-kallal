long_name: Machine-level Core-Local Interrupt Controller
description: |
  The Smclic extension provides support for the Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC) 
  at the machine level. CLIC is an advanced interrupt controller architecture that 
  provides low-latency, vectored, and preemptive interrupts for RISC-V systems.
  
  CLIC enhances interrupt handling capabilities by:
  
  * Supporting a larger number of interrupt sources with individual configuration
  * Providing hardware-assisted interrupt nesting and preemption
  * Enabling vectored interrupt handling with direct vector table addressing
  * Supporting selective hardware vectoring for reduced interrupt latency
  * Allowing fine-grained control of interrupt attributes (level vs edge-triggered, etc.)
  
  This extension adds the following CSRs:
  
  * mtvt - Machine Trap Vector Table register
  * mcause - Extended Machine Cause register with interrupt level information
  * mintstatus - Machine Interrupt Status register
  * mintthresh - Machine Interrupt Threshold register
  * mscratchcsw - Machine Scratch register for Context Switching
  * mscratchcswl - Machine Scratch register for Context Switching Lite
  * mclicbase - CLIC memory-mapped base address register
  
  This extension is currently in development state and not yet ratified.
