  Holds the interrupt ID and priority of the highest-priority pending interrupt
  that is not disabled by the corresponding bits in sie.

  When no interrupt is pending, the register reads 0. When an interrupt is pending,
  the register holds the interrupt ID in the Interrupt ID (IID) field.

  This register is read-only and is automatically updated by the hardware.
