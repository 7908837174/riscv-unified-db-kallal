long_name: Vector 8-bit Signed-Unsigned Dot Product (vector-vector)
description: |
  Vector quad widening signed-unsigned dot product instruction performing the dot product between a 4-element vector of 8-bit signed integer elements (vs2) and a 4-element vector of 8-bit unsigned integer elements (vs1), accumulating the result into a 32-bit signed integer accumulator.

  This instruction is only defined for SEW=32. It works on an element group with four 8-bit values stored together in a 32-bit bundle. For each input bundle for the dot product there is a corresponding (same index) SEW-wide element in the accumulator source (and destination).

  The "q" in the mnemonic indicates that the instruction is quad-widening. The number of body bundles is determined by `vl`. The operation can be masked, each mask bit determines whether the corresponding element result is active or not.

  The operation performed is:
  ```
  vd[i] = vs2[i][0] * vs1[i][0] + vs2[i][1] * vs1[i][1] + vs2[i][2] * vs1[i][2] + vs2[i][3] * vs1[i][3] + vd[i]
  ```

  Where vs2[i] is a 32-bit bundle containing four 8-bit signed integers and vs1[i] is a 32-bit bundle containing four 8-bit unsigned integers.
