sltiu:
  long_name: Set on less than immediate unsigned
  description: |
    Places the value 1 in register `rd` if register `rs1` is less than the sign-extended immediate
    when both are treated as unsigned numbers (_i.e._, the immediate is first sign-extended to
    XLEN bits then treated as an unsigned number), else 0 is written to `rd`.

    NOTE: `sltiu rd, rs1, 1` sets `rd` to 1 if `rs1` equals zero, otherwise sets `rd` to 0
    (assembler pseudoinstruction `SEQZ rd, rs`).
