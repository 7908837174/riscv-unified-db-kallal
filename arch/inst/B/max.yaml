    This instruction returns the larger of two signed integers.

    .Software Hint
    [NOTE]
    Calculating the absolute value of a signed integer can be performed using the
    following sequence: `neg rD,rS` followed by `max rD,rS,rD. When using this
    common sequence, it is suggested that they are scheduled with no intervening
    instructions so that implementations that are so optimized can fuse them
    together.
