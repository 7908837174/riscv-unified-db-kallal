  introduction: |
    The RVA profiles target application processors for markets
    requiring a high-degree of binary compatibility between compliant implementations.
  description: |
    The RVA profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
    processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode and
    supervisor-mode profiles are specified in this family.

    NOTE: There is no machine-mode profile currently defined for
    application processor families.  A machine-mode profile for
    application processors would only be used in specifying platforms for
    portable machine-mode software. Given the relatively low volume of
    portable M-mode software in this domain, the wide variety of potential
    M-mode code, and the very specific needs of each type of M-mode
    software, we are not specifying individual M-mode ISA requirements in
    the A-family profiles.

    NOTE: Only XLEN=64 application processor profiles are currently
    defined.  It would be possible to also define very similar XLEN=32
    variants.
  naming_scheme: |
    A profile name is a string comprised of, in order:

    * Prefix *RV* for RISC-V.
    * A specific profile family name string.  Initially a single letter (*I*, *M*, or *A*), but later profiles may have longer family name strings.
    * A numeric string giving the first complete calendar year for which the profile is ratified, represented as number of years after year 2000, i.e., *20* for profiles built on specifications ratified during 2019. The year string will be longer than two digits in the next century.
    * A privilege mode (*U*, *S*, *M*).  Hypervisor support is treated as an option.
    * A base ISA XLEN specifier (*32*, *64*).

    The initial profiles based on specifications ratified in 2019 are:

    * RVI20U32 basic unprivileged instructions for RV32I
    * RVI20U64 basic unprivileged instructions for RV64I
    * RVA20U64, RVA20S64 64-bit application-processor profiles

    NOTE: Profile names are embeddable into RISC-V ISA naming strings.
    This implies that there will be no standard ISA extension with a name
    that matches the profile naming convention.  This allows tools that
    process the RISC-V ISA naming string to parse and/or process a combined string.
