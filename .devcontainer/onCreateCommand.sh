## Where to Update

Make these changes in your workflow or the referenced test script ([. update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
github/workflows/container-tests.yml](https://github.com ```
**Code suggestions for workflow fixes:**

Add these steps before your test commands in `.github/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/blob/1/workflows/container-tests.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Ensure Pythonc4426e0935cac0cb6cd07480cac05bd995d36b4/.github/workflows/container-tests.yml)), or in [`tests/container_tests.sh`](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/blob/1c4426e0935cac0cb6cd07480cac05bd995d36b4/tests/container_tests.sh) if these commands are run there.

The failure is caused by an error in your Gemfile: you have specified the rake gem twice with conflicting version requirements:

rake (>= 0)
rake (~> 13.0)
Bundler cannot resolve these conflicting constraints.

Solution:
Edit your Gemfile to ensure rake is only specified once, with a single version requirement. For example, update the rake entry to:

Ruby
gem "rake", "~> 13.0"
or

Ruby
gem "rake", ">= 0"
but not both.

After fixing the Gemfile, commit the change and rerun the workflow.

Summary:
Remove the duplicate/conflicting rake gem version specification from your Gemfile.   AND Please find a solution for failing job 49714914430. Use the logs, job definition, and any referenced files where the failure occurred. Keep your response focused on the solution and include code suggestions when appropriate.
The job failed because the Gemfile specifies the same gem (rake) twice with different version requirements: one as rake (>= 0) and another as rake (~> 13.0). Bundler cannot resolve this conflict.

Solution:

Open your Gemfile and remove one of the duplicate rake specifications.
Make sure only one rake line remains, for example:
Ruby
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
Save the Gemfile and re-run the workflow.
Code suggestion: If your Gemfile currently has:

Ruby
gem 'rake', '>= 0'
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
Change it to:

Ruby
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
This will resolve the Bundler::Dsl::DSLError and allow your workflow to proceed.  AND Please find a solution for failing job 49714914409.

The job failed because the Gemfile specifies the rake gem twice with conflicting version requirements:

rake (>= 0)
rake (~> 13.0)
Bundler does not allow multiple version requirements for the same gem.

Solution: Edit your Gemfile to specify rake only once, with a single version constraint. For example:

Ruby
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
or

Ruby
gem 'rake', '>= 0'
—but do not include both.

Action Steps:

Open your Gemfile (likely at the project root).
Remove one of the rake gem lines so only one requirement remains.
Commit and push the fix.
You can review or edit your Gemfile directly:
riscv-unified-db/Gemfile@1c4426e0

After fixing, re-run the workflow and the error should be resolved.

The job failed due to a Bundler error in your Gemfile:

You cannot specify the same gem twice with different version requirements. You specified: rake (>= 0) and rake (~> 13.0). Bundler cannot continue.

Solution:
Edit your Gemfile and ensure that the rake gem is only specified once, with a single version requirement. For example, update it to:

Ruby
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'

Steps:

Open your Gemfile.
Remove one of the duplicate rake gem entries so only one remains, with a consistent version specification.

The failing job encountered a Bundler error due to duplicate gem entries in the Gemfile:

You cannot specify the same gem twice with different version requirements.
You specified: rake (>= 0) and rake (~> 13.0). Bundler cannot continue.

Solution:
Edit your Gemfile to remove the duplicate rake entry. Ensure only one version specification for rake, e.g.:

Ruby
# Remove one of the following if both exist:
gem 'rake', '>= 0'
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
The recommended fix is to keep only the more specific requirement:

Ruby
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
After updating the Gemfile, re-run your workflow. This will resolve the Bundler::Dsl::DSLError and allow the regression test job to proceed.

The job failed due to an error in your Gemfile: you specified the gem rake twice with conflicting version requirements—once as rake (>= 0) and again as rake (~> 13.0). Bundler does not allow the same gem to be listed with different version specs.

Solution: Edit your Gemfile to specify only one version requirement for rake. For example, replace both lines with:

Ruby
gem 'rake', '~> 13.0'
Or, if you want any version:

Ruby
gem 'rake'

There was an error parsing `Gemfile`: You cannot specify the same gem twice with different version requirements.

The failing job encountered two issues:

Trailing Whitespace:
The trim trailing whitespace pre-commit hook failed. This means some files had lines ending with unnecessary spaces.
Solution: Run the following command to automatically fix trailing whitespace in your repo:

Code
pre-commit run trailing-whitespace --all-files
Or, if you don’t have pre-commit installed, manually remove trailing spaces from all files, especially those changed in your PR.

Missing License Identifier in docker-compose.yml:
The reuse lint-file hook failed because the file docker-compose.yml does not contain a license identifier. Solution: Add the following SPDX license header at the top of your docker-compose.yml:

YAML
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
Replace MIT with your project’s license if it is different.

Code Suggestions:

At the top of docker-compose.yml, add:

YAML
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
Remove trailing whitespace across all files in your PR. Use an editor feature or pre-commit as described above.
