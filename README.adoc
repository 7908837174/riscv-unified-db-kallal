# RVI Spec Generator

## Prerequisites

The only requirement is the `Singularity CE` or `Apptainer` container system. Either one will work (they are forks).

If it is not installed, either as your IT admin or:

 * For Apptainer, see https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html[Apptainer Installation].
 * For Singularity CE, see https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/admin-guide/installation.html[Singularity CE Installation].

## Setup

Do once:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/setup

# or, if you also want development tools installed
# DEVELOPMENT=1 ./bin/setup

# or, if you also want to automatically install recommended VS Code extensions
# and you are running natively (not via a remote) VS Code
# VSCODE=1 ./bin/setup
----

If using Visual Studio Code and want to use development tools, you will need to restart the editor
after setup.
